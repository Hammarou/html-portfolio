<h1>The Best Movies According to Emeka</h1>
<h2>My favorite movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Godfather, part I</h3>
<pr>This classic movie considered (adapted from Mario Puzo's novel of the same name; and directed by Francis Ford Coppola) arguably one the greatest movies ever created.</pr>
<h3>The Godfather, part II</h3>
<P>One of the few sequels that is considered an even better film than it's ground breaking predecessor. Which is practically unheard of in cinematic history.</P>
<h3>Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>The first movie in the cinematic trilogy of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic novel--adapted by Peter Jackson--is still considered a ground breaking masterpiece, which stuck faithfully to the source material.</p>
<h3>Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<pr>The second movie in Peter Jackson's fantasy adventure movie's faithful rendition of the work by J. R. R. Tolkien. </pr>
<h3>Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<pr>The third, and final movie in the Lord of the Ring's trilogy. As with it's two predecessors it sticks closely with the book material and beautifully directed.</pr>
